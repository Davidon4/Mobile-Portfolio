                        DESCRIPTION OF THE APP AND ITS FEATURES

The idea behind the app is to build a quick, easy to use, user-friendly and understandable application, whereby any user that opens the app can easily navigate and understand the functionalities of the app.
This app allows both the landscape and portrait orientation. The main screen is the homescreen, which has a switch button at the top right header of the app. With this switch the user can decide which theme mode he/she wants. Under it is a welcome image, which explains the description of the app.
The next section are pressable cards of information of the owner of the app. Each card navigate to and explains the words on them.

- Personal Information Screen: This screeen contains the image, name and nickname of the owner of the resume
- About Screen: This screen contains information about the owner of the resume
- Socialmedia Screen: This screen contains four pressable cards which are the social media platform the owner is on, Each card with the use of link automatically links you to the profile of the owner of the resume.
- Experience Screen: This screen contains information about what the resume owner has to offer the company

                                    CODE BASE AND HOW IT WORKS

Simplicity has always been the keyword in creating this project, likewise with the codebase. The aim is to make it easy to move across each folders. The naming convention makes it easy to understand what a file/folder is about. All folders are placed under the resume app folder which is the parent folder. With this, the key reason is for anybody to easily navigate to a particular file without being easily confused. Function component with the use of hooks is what is being used and the use of context api to pass the theme children across all other screens. Linking is also used to link to other social media platform.

                                DESCRIPTION OF DESIGN AND HOW IT WORKS

The inspiration behind the design pattern was gotten from when I started learning react native and one of the lessons was to split the screens with flex. The 324 x 208 image on the screen is a greeting description to welcome users to the app. It has this galactic scene that makes it feels you are staring at a dark galaxy when you take a closer look at it. The section card below the image is designed with midnightblue with the text in the middle being white, the idea is to give it a bit of luxury but still maintain its simplicity and originality with the midnight vibe. It is a pressable card that navigates to the written name on it. This same section card can be seen in the social media screen with a different icon and name.

                                DESCRIPTION OF LIBRARIES USED AND WHY

- @expo-vector-icons: I was able add icons to the app
- react-native-event-listeners: I was able to bypass using redux and with react native event listener i passed a touch event on the which controls the theme of the app
- @react-navigation/native and @react-navigation/native-stack: With react native navigation, it was easy to navigate across the app

                                DESCRIPTION OF FEATURES I WOULD LIKE TO ADD

With time running out on me, I wasn't able to implement the multi language feature, If there was an added time I would like to add it to the app. I would like to add an authentication system to know the number of people that visited my resume and also create a chatting system to talk directly to potential client.

                                CHALLENGES I FACED AND HOW I SOLVED THEM

I faced some challenges in creating the theme mode, as I didn't want to use redux to pass to pass events, Another challenge I faced was setting the screen to accept a landscape mode as I had already finished designing before I saw it, so I had to restructure my designs to fit in and accept the landscape mode.
